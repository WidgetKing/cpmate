# Sliders
Sliders are an interactive element that have two visual elements:
- The handle: A symbol which the user can drag back and forth either horizontally or vertically.
- The track: A symbol which defines the limits of where the handle can be dragged.

Additionally, sliders can be linked to a Captivate Variable. Once linked, the slider will update the Captivate variable with the handle's current position.

Sliders are also a valuable way of quizzing the learner. CpMate allows you to set when the slider should be evaluated, as well as what action to take in response to evaluation.

::: tip Why is this in CpMate and not CpExtra?
If we did not have to support responsive Captivate projects, Sliders would be a viable feature for CpExtra. But as it is, moving things around on stage in a Captivate Responsive project is extremely difficult.

Adobe Animate OAMs however, work well in responsive and non-responsive projects. As Animate does not have the same responsive headaches that Captivate does, we thought CpMate was the best home for this feature.
