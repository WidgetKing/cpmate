# Captivate Syncing
This is the feature we use most often here at Infosemantics and is the primary reason why we developed CpMate in the first place.
This feature allows Adobe Animate HTML5 exports to play back inside of Captivate without losing sync with the timeline. If you developed Captivate courses back in the Flash SWF days, this proceedure may sound familiar to you.

The **CpExtra** (Not CpMate) install files came with a file called: **GotoLabel.xml**

This file defines a custom Adobe Captivate effect which can be imported into Captivate and applied to the Animate OAM Web Object. Because effects can be dragged back and forth along the Web Object's timeline, we can use them to set a time marker. Through editing the effect's options we can state what we wish to happen when the Captivate playback reaches this point in time.
