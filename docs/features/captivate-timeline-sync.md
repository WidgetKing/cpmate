# Captivate Timeline Sync
This is the feature we use most often here at Infosemantics and is the primary reason why we developed CpMate in the first place.
This feature allows Adobe Animate HTML5 exports to play back inside of Captivate without losing sync with the timeline. If you developed Captivate courses back in the Flash SWF days, this proceedure may sound familiar to you.
