# Animate Config
Once you have bought CpMate you can install it in three steps.

### Step #1
Place the **Infosemantics_CpMate.js** folder you know you won't move or delete.
::: tip When working with a team
If you have multiple developers working on one course, all will be editing and publishing the Adobe Animate file. 

You will therefore need the *Infosemantics_CpMate.js* file *installed in the same folder on all machines*.

Therefore, we highly recommend creating a folder at the top of one of your drives (ideally the C Drive) and storing CpMate there.
Something like: C:\_PROJECTS\_RESOURCES\Infosemantics_CpMate.js

Otherwise, if each developer places the Infosemantics_CpMate.js file in a different location, they must repeat the following **step #2** each time they receive the Adobe Animate project.

### Step #2
Open up your Adobe Animate project.
Go to the Actions Panel.
**Continue writing instructions Tristan**

### Step #3
Animate has a feature called 'hosted libraries' which means it downloads essential Javascript files from the internet every time the Animate OAM is run. This can cause a variety of problems, so to prevent future technical support please do the following:
1. In Adobe Animate go to File > Publish Settings...
2. Select the Javascript/HTML settings
3. Move to the HTML/js tab
4. Uncheck Hosted Libraries
