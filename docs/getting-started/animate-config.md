# Animate Config
Once you have bought CpMate you can install it in three steps.

### Step #1
Place the *Infosemantics_CpMate.js* file in a directory where you'll know you won't move or delete it.
::: tip
Say you had two developers working on one course. Both will be editing and publishing the Adobe Animate file. 
You will need to have the *Infosemantics_CpMate.js* file *installed in the same folder on both machines*.
Therefore, we highly recommend creating a folder at the top of one of your drives (ideally the C Drive) and storing CpMate there.
Something like: C:\_PROJECTS\_RESOURCES\Infosemantics_CpMate.js?

### Step #2
Open up your Adobe Animate project.
Go to the Actions Panel.
**Continue writing instructions Tristan**

## Step #3
Animate has a feature called 'hosted libraries' which means it downloads essential Javascript files from the internet every time the Animate OAM is run. This can cause a variety of problems, so to prevent future technical support please do the following:
1. In Adobe Animate go to File > Publish Settings...
2. Select the Javascript/HTML settings
3. Move to the HTML/js tab
4. Uncheck Hosted Libraries
