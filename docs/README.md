- title: Sync Animations with Captivate Timeline
  details: Build the animation in Adobe Animate, but time the animation to the voiceover in Captivate. Live, visible from Captivate's timeline.
- title: Interact with Captivate Variables
  details: Changing a Captivate variable from Animate is as easy as writing X.captivate.variables.MyVar = "New Value";
- title: Build interactions
  details: Build sliders, have MovieClips change their frame based on a Captivate variable, display a Captivate Variable value in a dynamic textfield in Animate. All this and more.
- title: Load your Javascript code into Captivate
  details: CpMate can act as a platform to load your own Javascript Libraries directly into Captivate. Need to update the code? Just republish the Adobe Animate project and update it in Captivate. No more tinkering with Captivate's HTML templates!
