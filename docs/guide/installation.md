# Installation
Once you have bought CpMate you can install it in two steps.

## Step #1
Place it in a directory where you'll know you won't move or delete it.
::: tip
Create a folder at the top of one of your drives (ideally the C Drive) and put CpMate there.
You'll especially want to do this if you're sharing your animate files with other developers as they will need to have CpMate installed in the same directory.

## Step #2
Open up your Adobe Animate project.
Go to the Actions Panel.
Continue writing instructions.
