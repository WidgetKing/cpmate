# Updating

Sometimes Animate does not seem to export a new version of our animation or Captivate does not import the latest version of our animation. What can we do then?

## Animate fails to export latest animation
Navigate to the export folder for the JS/HTML export. Delete all export files. Republish. 

You may need to delete the export files every time you want to publish a new version of the animation.

## Captivate fail to import latest animation
Ensure the OAM file has a **different name** to the previous OAM file. For example
- Previous: my_animation_1
- New: my_animation_2
