# About Troubleshooting
So you're having trouble with CpMate, eh?
Well we are here to help. We only ask one thing. Before contacting us PLEASE review the troubleshooting guide to see whether we've already written help on the issue you're encountering.
Quite a lot of time gets spent supporting our products and that cuts into the time we can spend building and improving our products. So we thank you for taking the time to review this information.

## Nope, I really can't work this out
Okay then. You can reach us through the [contact form on infosemantics.com.au](http://www.infosemantics.com.au/contact)
::: tip
To help us track down the issue quicker, please prepare a Captivate/Animate document that demonstrates your issue. We can then test it. Usually just a description does not give us enough information to track down the issue.
