# Misc
Here are some issues that don't fit into any of the other categories in this guide.

## Adobe Animate's actions panel doesn't show the global option
You're probably using an ActionScript 3.0 Adobe Animate project. You'll need to convert it to a HTML5 Canvas project by going to: File > Convert To > HTML5 Canvas.

## Adobe Animate doesn't show OAM export option
Same as previous issue.
